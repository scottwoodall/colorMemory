# Color Memory

A weekend project where I wanted to play with [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and the [Flux architecture](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html). 

A simple memory game based on colors that can be played [here](http://scottwoodall.com/colorMemory/).  Inspiration for the concept came from this [Hacker News post.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8013143)
