# Color Memory

A weekend project where I wanted to play with [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and the [Flux architecture](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html). 

A simple memory game based on colors that can be played [here](http://scottwoodall.com/colorMemory/).  Inspiration for the concept came from this [Hacker News post.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8013143)

#### Development
1. `git clone https://github.com/scottwoodall/colorMemory.git`
2. `cd colorMemory; npm install`
3. `npm start`

`npm run-script build` will create a minified version of `static/js/bundle.js`.
